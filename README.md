# Typescript Codebase

## Getting Started

<strong>Definition</strong>

<b>TypeScript</b> is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

<strong>Installation</strong>

TypeScript can be installed through three installation routes depending on how you intend to use it: an npm module, a NuGet package or a Visual Studio Extension.

If you are using Node.js, you want the npm version. If you are using MSBuild in your project, you want the NuGet package or Visual Studio extension.

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
